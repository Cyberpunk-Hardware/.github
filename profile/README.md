# About Unspent Space
A clubhouse for bitcoiners and cypherpunks, starting in Melbourne

Note: this organisation is at a very early stage, and this is essentially a draft.

**Mission**: To facilitate the growth of bitcoin and cypherpunk culture in local neighbourhoods.

**Vision**: To create local meatspaces for bitcoiners and cypherpunks to work, share and create.

**Values**: not in a particular order, we value:
- Bitcoin as sound money technology
- Free and Open Source Software
- Privacy
- Self-sovereignty
- Education
